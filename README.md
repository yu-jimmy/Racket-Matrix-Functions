# Racket-Matrix-Functions

Used the programming language Racket, which is a dialect of Lisp and a descendant of Scheme, to implement basic matrix functions, such as matrix multiplication and addition, vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and transpose.

These functions were implemented with the help of lambda functions, recursion or using higher order functions such as map, apply, filter, etc.
